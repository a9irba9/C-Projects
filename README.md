# C Projects
It's a number guessing game written in C language.
It randomly generates a number between 0 to 100.
The player has to guess the number in the entire game.
If the player guesses higher than the random number, it displays "Lower Number Please!".
And if the guessed number is higher than the random number, it displays "Higher Number Please!".
It also displays how many guesses the player took.


And That's all.
